# Showdown Data

**This module is copied from poke-env: https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env/tree/master/src/poke_env/data**

Data files are generated by parsing the Showdown Dex `.ts` files. Metamon patches some bugs for early generations:

1. Abilities do not appear in data files until the generation they were introduced. Improves process-of-elimination ability identification.
    - Gen 1 and Gen 2 have no abilities; every Pok√©mon's ability is listed as "No Ability"
2. Edits to gen 1 `move` data edge cases are moved to the data files themselves.

We only keep a copy like this in order to leave the poke-env version frozen for backwards compatability with our original models.
