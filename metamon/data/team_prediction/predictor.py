        Scores a diff between a current Pokemon and a candidate predicted Pokemon.

        The basic problem we need to address is the difference between a moveset that is frequently *possible* vs. a moveset that is frequently *used*.
        Our replay stats track the number of real movesets that *could be* each candidate, but in reality some of these are very unlikely.

        For example, in gen1ou, it is common for Tauros to reveal {Earthquake, Body Slam, Hyper Beam} during a battle.
        Our candidates computed by the replay stats will find us all the movesets that have these three moves.
        There are many choices for the 4th move that have appeared at some point. The "weights" assigned to each candidate
        from the replay stats will give options that look something like this:
            Blizzard, weight=6812
            Fire Blast, weight=5574
            Rest, weight=5507
            Stomp, weight=5507
            ...
            Thunder, weight=4709
            Swords Dance, weight=3333
        Stomp/Thunder/Swords Dance are dramatically overrepresented because many replays are consistent with these movesets,
        but in reality that are much more rarely used.

        This function adjusts candidates based on the usage stats of their suggested additions, e.g. P(Fire Blast|Tauros) >> P(Thunder|Tauros).
