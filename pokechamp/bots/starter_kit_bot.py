Starter Kit Bot: Basic LLM-based Pokémon Bot

This is a simple example showing how to create your own LLM-based Pokémon bot
using the PokéChamp framework. This example uses the "io" (input-output) prompt format,
which is the most basic and easiest to understand.

To create your own bot:
1. Copy this file and rename it
2. Modify the system prompt and constraint prompts to match your strategy
3. Add your own custom logic in the choose_move method if needed
4. Test your bot using the provided scripts
